# cube

![alt tag](https://www.grubiks.com/images/rc.png)

TIPE project: build a machine that can solve a Rubik's cube.

I'll probably use Python to: 

* detect to color on faces (with a lib like OpenCV)

* move motors with GPIO pins on a raspberry pi, or arduino (or maybe PocketChip)

* create a GUI to control all these things (Tkinter) :rainbow:
